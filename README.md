P1) Guessing Game
Write a number guessing game. Keep asking the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 until they guess correctly. If the number the user guesses is too high, tell them so. Same with if the number is too low. Congratulate them when theyâ€™ve guessed the correct number and tell them how many guesses they used to get to the correct number.
