P1) Guessing Game
Write a number guessing game. Keep asking the user to guess a number between 1 and 100 until they guess correctly. If the number the user guesses is too high, tell them so. Same with if the number is too low. Congratulate them when theyâ€™ve guessed the correct number and tell them how many guesses they used to get to the correct number.

P2) Common Words
Write a function that takes in two lists of words and returns a list of the words common to both original lists.
For example, given ["hello", "adios", "goodbye", "hola", "au revoir", "bonjour"] and ["hello", "welcome","thanks", "goodbye", "please"], return ["hello", "goodbye"].
